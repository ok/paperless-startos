# Paperless-ngx

Paperless-ngx is a document management system that scans, indexes, and archives your physical documents. It runs OCR, organizes files by tags and correspondents, and exposes a fast searchable web interface.

## First-run setup

1. Start the service and wait for the **Web Interface** health check to turn green. The first start may take a minute or two while databases are migrated and OCR resources are unpacked.
2. Run the **Set Admin Password** action — it is surfaced as a critical task until you do. It generates a password for the `admin` user and displays it once; copy it somewhere safe.
3. Open the **Web UI** interface and sign in as `admin`.

Forgot your password, or want a new one? Run **Set Admin Password** again at any time — it resets the `admin` password and shows you the new one.

## Adding documents

- **Web upload**: use the drag-and-drop area in the Paperless-ngx UI.
- **Email**: configure a mail account under **Settings → Mail** in the Paperless-ngx UI and it will fetch and consume attachments automatically — handy for scanners that scan-to-email.
- **Mobile apps and API**: any Paperless-ngx-compatible app can upload via the API using your Web UI address and an API token from your user profile.

> **Note**: The watched *consume folder* lives on a volume that is not reachable from other StartOS services or your other devices today, so use one of the methods above instead.
